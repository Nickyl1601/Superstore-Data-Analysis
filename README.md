# Nickyl1601-Superstore-Data-Analysis
This project involved creating an interactive logistics dashboard from Tableau to help a logistics
company evaluate its international delivery performance and identify shipment bottlenecks. The
data analyzed were in the Global Superstore dataset, with detailed transaction data by country,
category, and date. The objective was predominantly to transform raw delivery and sales data into
useful dashboards that could aid in better decision-making around logistics operations.
